Getting Started Guides
MLflow Tracking
MLflow Tracking is one of the primary service components of MLflow. In these guides, you will gain an understanding of what MLflow Tracking can do to enhance your MLOps related activities while building ML models.

The basics of MLflow tracking

In these introductory guides to MLflow Tracking, you will learn how to leverage MLflow to:

Log training statistics (loss, accuracy, etc.) and hyperparameters for a model
Log (save) a model for later retrieval
Register a model using the MLflow Model Registry to enable deployment
Load the model and use it for inference
In the process of learning these key concepts, you will be exposed to the MLflow Tracking APIs, the MLflow Tracking UI, and learn how to add metadata associated with a model training event to an MLflow run.

Autologging Basics
A great way to get started with MLflow is to use the autologging feature. Autologging automatically logs your model, metrics, examples, signature, and parameters with only a single line of code for many of the most popular ML libraries in the Python ecosystem.

Run Comparison Basics
This quickstart tutorial focuses on the MLflow UI's run comparison feature and provides a step-by-step walkthrough of registering the best model found from a hyperparameter tuning execution sweep. After locally serving the registered model, a brief example of preparing a model for remote deployment by containerizing the model using Docker is covered.

How to Run Tutorials
This brief guide will walk you through some options that you have to run these tutorials and have a Tracking Server that is available to log the results to (as well as offering options for the MLflow UI).

1. Download the Notebook
You can download the tutorial notebook by clicking on the "Download the Notebook" button at the top of each tutorial page.

2. Install MLflow
Install MLflow from PyPI by running the following command:

pip install mlflow

tip
üí° We recommend creating a new virtual environment with tool like venv, uv, Poetry, to isolate your ML experiment environment from other projects.

3. Set Up MLflow Tracking Server (Optional)
Direct Access Mode (no tracking server)
You can start a tutorial and log models, experiments without a tracking server set up. With this mode, your experiment data and artifacts are saved directly under your current directory.

While this mode is the easiest way to get started, it is not recommended for general use:

The experiment data is only visible on the UI when you run mlflow ui command from the same directory.
The experiment data cannot be accessible from other team members.
You may lose your experiment data if you accidentally delete the directory.
Running with Tracking Server (recommended)
MLflow Tracking Server is a centralized HTTP server that allows you to access your experiments artifacts regardless of where you run your code. To use the Tracking Server, you can either run it locally or use a managed service. Click on the following links to learn more about each option:

MLflow can be used in a variety of environments, including your local environment, on-premises clusters, cloud platforms, and managed services. Being an open-source platform, MLflow is vendor-neutral; no matter where you are doing machine learning, you have access to the MLflow's core capabilities sets such as tracking, evaluation, observability, and more.

tip
üí° If you are not a Databricks user but want to try out its managed MLflow experience for free, we recommend using the

Databricks Free Trial . It offers a personal Databricks account with service credits that are valid for a limited time period, letting you get started with MLflow and other ML/AI tools in minutes.

4. Connecting Notebook with Tracking Server
note
If you are on Databricks, you can skip this section because a notebook is already connected to the tracking server and an MLflow experiment.

For other managed service (e.g., SageMaker, Nebius), please refer to the documentation provided by the service provider.

Once the tracking server is up, connect your notebook to the server by calling mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://<your-mlflow-server>:<port>"). For example, if you are running the tracking server locally on port 5000, you would call:

mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")

This will ensure that all MLflow runs, experiments, traces, and artifacts are logged to the specified tracking server.

5. Ready to Run!
Now that you have set up your MLflow environment, you are ready to run the tutorials. Go back to the tutorial and enjoy the journey of learning MLflow!üö¢
