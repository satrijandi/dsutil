# Code Refactoring

## Task
Identify and refactor existing code to improve maintainability, readability, and organization.

## Potential Refactoring Areas

### 1. main_modular.py
- Large main function could be broken into smaller functions
- Error handling could be centralized
- Configuration loading could be abstracted

### 2. Utils modules
- Some functions might have too many responsibilities
- Duplicate logic across modules
- Magic numbers should be constants

### 3. Code Organization
- Add type hints where missing
- Improve docstring consistency
- Extract common patterns

## Priority
1. main_modular.py - main pipeline orchestration
2. Utility modules - extract common patterns
3. Configuration management - centralize config handling
